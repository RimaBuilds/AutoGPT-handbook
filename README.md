# Autogpt: A  Guide to Prompt Engineering
Autogpt is a state-of-the-art end-to-end platform for developing Neural Language Processing (NLP) models. Built on top of the OpenAI GPT architecture, Autogpt streamlines the process of training, customizing, and deploying NLP models by automating a significant proportion of the development process.

In this guide, we'll explore the various features of Autogpt and outline the best practices and tips for utilizing Autogpt. 

## Installation Guide to Autogpt
:\n\nðŸš€ **Installation Guide**\n\n1. To install AutoGPT, we need to first clone the Github repository. You can do this using the command: \n\n   ```git clone https://github.com/autogpt/autogpt.git```\n\n   This command will clone the AutoGPT repository to your local machine.\n\n2. Once you have downloaded the repository, navigate to the `autogpt` directory in your terminal.\n\n3. Install the required dependencies using the command:\n   \n   ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` \n   \n   This will install all the necessary packages required to run AutoGPT.\n\n4. Next, run the command: \n\n   ```python setup.py install```\n   \n   This command will install AutoGPT.\n\n5. Verify that the installation was successful by running the command:\n\n   ```autogpt --version```\n   \n   You should see the version number displayed in the terminal.\n\nðŸ”‘ **API Needed for AutoGPT**\n\n1. OpenAI API Key - this key is required to use the OpenAI API which AutoGPT is built on top of. You can get an API key by signing up for the [OpenAI API program](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).\n\n2. GPT3_API_SECRET_KEY - this key is required to authenticate your request to the OpenAI API. You can get this key by following the steps on the OpenAI API website.\n\n3. GPT3_API_KEY - this key is required to authorize your access to the OpenAI API. You can also get this key by following the steps on the OpenAI API website.\n\nOnce you have obtained these keys, you need to edit the `secrets.json` file in the repository and add the API keys listed above.\n\nðŸ”„ **Changes When Cloning the Github Repository**\n\n1. You need to edit the `secrets.json` file in the repository and add the API keys listed above. This is because the API keys are sensitive information that should not be hardcoded into the application. By adding them to the `secrets.json` file, you ensure that the keys are kept secure and not exposed to potential attackers.\n\n2. You also need to add your own prompts to the `prompts.json` file to make AutoGPT more useful for your particular use case. The prompts provided in the repository are general prompts that may not be applicable to your project. By adding your own prompts, you can train AutoGPT to generate responses that are tailored to your specific use case.\n\nðŸŽ¨ **Prompt Engineering Guide**\n\n1. To prompt AutoGPT, use the command:\n\n   ```autogpt -p <prompt>```\n   \n   Replace `<prompt>` with the text that you want to prompt the model with.\n\n2. You can also run AutoGPT in interactive mode by using the command:\n\n   ```autogpt -i```\n   \n   This will allow you to input prompts and get responses from the model in real-time.\n   \n3. For best results, make sure your prompts are specific and well-defined. This will give AutoGPT a clear understanding of what you are trying to achieve and help it generate more accurate responses.\n\n4. When reviewing the model's responses, keep in mind that AutoGPT is a language model and not a human. As such, it may generate responses that are not entirely accurate or suitable for your use case. It is up to you to review the responses and make any necessary modifications.\n\n5. Another way to use AutoGPT is by integrating it into your code. You can import the `AutoGPT` class into your code and use it to generate responses programmatically. This can be useful if you want to generate responses in a specific context or if you want to automate the generation of text.\n\nI hope this expanded guide is helpful! Let me know if you have any further questions on using AutoGPT or the installation process."

## Best Ways for Prompt Engineering
Here are some of the best ways to use Autogpt for prompt engineering:

1. Use Autogpt to generate code snippets:
   ```
   prompt = "Generate a function to get the sum of two numbers"
   from autogpt import GPT

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt)
   response = generator.generate()
   generated_function = response.choices[0].text
   print(generated_function)
   ```

2. Use Autogpt to check code syntax:
   ```
   code_string = '' # your code
   from autogpt import GPT

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=code_string)
   response = generator.generate()
   generated_output = response.choices[0].text
   print(generated_output)
   ```

3. Use Autogpt to improve code:
   ```
   from autogpt import GPT

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002")
   code_string = '' # your code
   response = generator.generate(prompt=code_string, max_length=100, temperature=0.5, n=2, best_of=1, stop_sequence=['\n', '\r\n', '.', '!', '?'], num_return_sequences=1)
   improved_output = response.choices[0].text
   print(improved_output)
   ```

4. Use Autogpt to generate test cases:
   ```
   prompt = "Write a test to check the sum of two numbers"
   from autogpt import GPT

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt)
   response = generator.generate()
   generated_test = response.choices[0].text
   print(generated_test)
   ```

5. Use Autogpt to generate documentation:
   ```
   prompt = "Generate documentation for the function 'Function name'"
   from autogpt import GPT

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002", prompt=prompt)
   response = generator.generate()
   generated_documentation = response.choices[0].text
   print(generated_documentation)
   ```

   file_name = "" # name of your python file you want to execute
   from autogpt import GPT
   import os

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002")
   response = generator.generate(prompt="Execute the file " + file_name)
   generated_output = response.choices[0].text
   os.system("python " + file_name + " " + generated_output)
   ```

8. Use Autogpt for browsing the internet
   ```
   from autogpt import GPT
   import webbrowser

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002")
   response = generator.generate(prompt="Open Google search page")
   search_query = response.choices[0].text
   url = f"https://www.google.com/search?q={search_query}"
   webbrowser.open(url)
   ```

9. Use Autogpt for searching files
   ```
   from autogpt import GPT
   import os

   generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002")
   response = generator.generate(prompt="Search for files with keyword")
   keyword = response.choices[0].text
   for root, dirs, files in os.walk("."):
       for file in files:
           if keyword in file:
               print(os.path.join(root, file))
   ```

10. Use Autogpt for code completion:
    ```
    from autogpt import GPT

    generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002")
    response = generator.generate(prompt="Complete code snippet for 'Function name'")
    generated_output = response.choices[0].text
    print(generated_output)
    ```

11. Use Autogpt for auto-prompt:
    ```
    from autogpt import GPT

    generator = GPT(engine="text-davinci-002")
    response = generator.generate(prompt="")
    generated_output = response.choices[0].text
    print(generated_output)
    ```
